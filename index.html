            Seeing with my two eyes rolling and open wide, no it can't be, <br>
            Copy paste poetry? ? ? Can't call it your own piece, <br>
            Not a genuine poet; with false charade and intelligence. <br>
            <br>
            Copy paste poetry lines from the internet search out, <br>
            Words are flowery so as lines are always with doubt, <br>
            Lies behind the copy paste poems, it gains distrust, <br>
            Craft your poem with honesty and integrity, please do my dear poet. <br>
